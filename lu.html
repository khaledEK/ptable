    <p style="margin-top: 20%">

      <p>Lutetium is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, but not in moist air.
      It is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements.</p>
      <p>Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James.
      All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium.</p>
      <p>The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other.
      The naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier.
      In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones.</p>
      <p>Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, although it is significantly more common than silver in the earth's crust.</p>
      <p>Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 38 billion years, used to determine the age of minerals and meteorites.
      Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions.
      <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy on neuroendocrine tumours.</p>
      <p>Lutetium has the highest Brinell hardness of any lanthanide, at 890â€“1300 MPa.</p>
