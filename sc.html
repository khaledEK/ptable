      <p>Scandium is a silvery-white metallic d-block element.</p> 
      <p>Historically, it has been classified as a rare-earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides.
      Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide.</p> 
      <p>It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.
      Because of the low availability and difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s, when the positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered. 
      To this day, its use in such alloys remains its only major application.</p> 
      <p>The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. 
      A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium.</p>
