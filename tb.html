      <p>Terbium is a silvery-white, rare earth metal that is malleable, and ductile.
      Terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas.</p>
      <p>Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.</p>
      <p>Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium as a chemical element in 1843.
      He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
      Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques.</p>
      <p>Terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells that operate at elevated temperatures.
      As a component of Terfenol-D (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors.</p>
      <p>Most of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors.
      Terbium oxide is in fluorescent lamps and television and monitor cathode-ray tubes (CRTs).
      Terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide trichromatic lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.</p>
