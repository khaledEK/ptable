      <p>Manganese is a hard, brittle, silvery metal, often found in minerals in combination with iron. 
      Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.</p> 
      <p>It improves strength, workability, and resistance to wear. 
      Manganese oxide is used as an oxidising agent; as a rubber additive; and in glass making, fertilisers, and ceramics. 
      Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide.</p>
      <p>Manganese was first isolated in 1774. 
      It is familiar in the laboratory in the form of the deep violet salt potassium permanganate.</p>
      <p>Manganese is also an essential human dietary element, important in macronutrient metabolism, bone formation, and free radical defense systems. 
      It is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes.
      It is found mostly in the bones, but also the liver, kidneys, and brain.</p>
      <p>In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes. 
      It occurs at the active sites in some enzymes.</p>
      <p>Of particular interest is the use of a Mn-O cluster, the oxygen-evolving complex, in the production of oxygen by plants.</p>
