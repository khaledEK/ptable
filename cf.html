      <p>Californium was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions).
      It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye.</p>
      <p>Two crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure: one above and one below 900 Â°C.
      A third form exists at high pressure.
      Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature.</p>
      <p>Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state.
      The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years.
      This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p><sup>252</sup>Cf, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.</p>
      <p>Californium is one of the few transuranium elements with practical applications.
      Most of these applications exploit the property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons.
      For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy.</p>
      <p>Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; oganesson was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions.
      Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.</p>
