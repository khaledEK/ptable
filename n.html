      <p style="font-size: 120%">Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. 
      At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N<sub>2</sub>, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas. 
      N<sub>2</sub> forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. 
      The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (Nâ‰¡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. 
      This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N<sub>2</sub> into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. 
      Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.
      Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. 
      Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. 
      Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.</p>
