      <p>Samarium is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air.
      Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually has the oxidation state +3.</p>
      <p>Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide.
      The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis.</p>
      <p>Samarium was discovered in 1879 by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.</p>
      <p>Though classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in Earth's crust and more common than metals such as tin.
      Samarium occurs in concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element.
      These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.</p>
      <p>The main commercial use of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets.
      However, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above 700 °C, without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point.</p>
      <p>Samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and so is added to control rods of nuclear reactors.
      It also forms as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation
      Other uses of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and X-ray lasers.</p>
      <p>The radioisotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. 
      Samarium has no significant biological role, and some samarium salts are slightly toxic.</p>
