      <p>Dysprosium is a rare-earth element in the lanthanide series with a metallic silver luster.
      Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though, like other lanthanides, it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime.
      Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most abundant of which is <sup>164</sup>Dy.</p>
      <p>Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul Ã‰mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion-exchange techniques in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements.
      It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data-storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material).</p>
      <p>Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.</p>
