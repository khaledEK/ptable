      <p>Neodymium is a hard, slightly malleable, silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture.
      When oxidized, neodymium reacts quickly producing pink, purple/blue and yellow compounds in the +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states.
      It is generally regarded as having one of the most complex spectra of the elements.</p>
      <p>Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who also discovered praseodymium.</p>
      <p>It is considered to be one of the rare-earth metals.
      It is present in significant quantities in the minerals monazite and bastn√§site.
      Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use.
      Neodymium is fairly common and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p>Most of the world's commercial neodymium is mined in China, as is the case with many other rare-earth metals.</p>
      <p>Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927 and remain a popular additive.
      The color of neodymium compounds comes from the Nd<sup>3+</sup> ion and is often a reddish-purple.
      However, this changes with the type of lighting because of the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium.</p>
      <p>Neodymium-doped glasses are used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers.
      These lasers have been used in extremely high-power applications, such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion.
      Neodymium is also used with various other substrate crystals, such as yttrium aluminium garnet in the Nd:YAG laser.</p>
      <p>Neodymium alloys are used to make high-strength neodymium magnets which is a type of powerful permanent magnet.
      These magnets are widely used in products like microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones, high-performance hobby DC electric motors, and computer hard disks, where low magnet mass (or volume) or strong magnetic fields are required.
      Larger neodymium magnets are used in electric motors with a high power-to-weight ratio (e.g., in hybrid cars) and generators (e.g., aircraft and wind turbine electric generators).</p>
