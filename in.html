      <p>Indium is the softest metal that is not an alkali metal.
      It is a silvery-white metal that resembles tin in appearance.
      It is a post-transition metal that makes up 0.21 parts per million of the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p>Indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin.
      Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two in terms of its properties.</p>
      <p>Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods.
      Indium was isolated the next year.</p>
      <p>Indium is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement.</p>
      <p>It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and in the production of transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass.
      Indium is considered a technology-critical element.</p>
      <p>Indium has no biological role.
      Its compounds are toxic when injected into the bloodstream.
      Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.</p>
