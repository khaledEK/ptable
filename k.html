      <p>Potassium is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife.
      Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. 
      In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals.</p> 
      <p>In nature, potassium occurs only in ionic salts.</p> 
      <p>Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. 
      It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks.</p>
      <p>Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium. 
      It was suspected in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts, and this was proven in 1807 through using electrolysis.</p> 
      <p>Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which <sup>40</sup>K is radioactive. 
      Traces of <sup>40</sup>K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.</p>
      <p>Potassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. 
      The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission.
      potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities.</p> 
      <p>Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. 
      The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from outside to inside cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.</p>
      <p>Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.</p>
