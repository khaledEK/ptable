      <p style="font-size: 120%">Argon is a noble gas.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Argon is the third-most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). 
      It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor, 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide, and more than 500 times as abundant as neon.
      Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.
      Nearly all of the argon in Earth's atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in Earth's crust. 
      In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">The complete octet (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Argon is extracted industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. 
      Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. 
      Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. 
      Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.</p>
