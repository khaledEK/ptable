    <p style="height: 20px; margin-top: 12%">Naming:  from "Niobe" who was the daughter of Tantalus from Greek mythology because of its chemical similarity to tantalum</p>


    <p style="margin-top: 40%">

      <p>Niobium is a light grey, crystalline, and ductile transition metal.
      Pure niobium has a Mohs hardness rating similar to pure titanium, and it has similar ductility to iron.</p>
      <p>Niobium oxidizes in Earth's atmosphere very slowly, hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel.
      Niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite.</p> 
      <p>English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium.
      German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium.
      In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element, and for a century both names were used interchangeably.
      Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949.</p>
      <p>It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially.
      Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of 60â€“70% niobium with iron.</p>
      <p>Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines.
      Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel by scavenging carbide and nitride.</p>
      <p>The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.
      Niobium is used in various superconducting materials.</p>
      <p>These alloys, also containing titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners.</p>
      <p>Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics, and jewelry.
      In the last two applications, the low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties.</p>
      <p>Niobium is considered a technology-critical element.</p>
