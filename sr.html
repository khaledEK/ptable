      <p>An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive.
      The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air.
      Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table.</p>
      <p>It occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite, and is mostly mined from these.</p>
      <p>It was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color.
      Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis.</p>
      <p>During the 19th century, strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets.
      At the peak of production of television cathode-ray tubes, as much as 75% of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass.
      With the replacement of cathode-ray tubes with other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.</p>
      <p>While natural strontium (which is mostly the isotope strontium-88) is stable, the synthetic strontium-90 is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium.
      Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.</p>
