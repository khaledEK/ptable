      <p>Nickel is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. 
      Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal.</p> 
      <p>Pure nickel is chemically reactive but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. 
      Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. 
      An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.</p>
      <p>Use of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. 
      Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden.</p> 
      <p>Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. 
      Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets.</p> 
      <p>The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.</p> 
      <p>About 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. 
      A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs).</p>
      <p>Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. 
      As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments.</p>
      <p>Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.</p>
