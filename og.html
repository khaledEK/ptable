      <p>Oganesson is a synthetic chemical element.</p>
      <p>It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists.
      In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP.
      It was formally named on 28 November 2016.</p>
      <p>It is one of only two elements named after a person who was alive at the time of naming, the other being seaborgium, and the only element whose eponym is alive as of 2023.</p>
      <p>Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements.</p>
      <p>The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope oganesson-294 have been detected.
      Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones.
      For example, although oganesson is a member of group 18 (the noble gases), it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group.</p>
      <p>It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects.</p>
