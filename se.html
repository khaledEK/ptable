      <p>Selenium is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table and also has similarities to arsenic.
      It seldom occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p>Selenium was discovered in 1817 by JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium.</p>
      <p>Selenium is found in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur.
      Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production.
      Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare.</p>
      <p>The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments.
      Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells.
      Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly replaced with silicon semiconductor devices.
      Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.</p>
      <p>Although trace amounts of selenium are necessary for cellular function in many animals, including humans, both elemental selenium and (especially) selenium salts are toxic in even small doses, causing selenosis.</p>
      <p>Selenium is listed as an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, as well as in infant formula.
      It is alse a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants) as well as in 3 deiodinase enzymes.</p>
      <p>Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently not requiring any.</p>
