      <p>Cerium is a soft, ductile, and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air.
      While it often shows the oxidation state of +3 characteristic of the series, it also has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water.</p>
      <p>It is also considered one of the rare-earth elements.
      Despite always occurring in combination with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastnäsite groups, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state in aqueous solution.</p>
      <p>It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium.
      It is the 25th-most abundant element, making up 66 ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.</p>
      <p>Cerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden, by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany in the same year.
      In 1839 Carl Gustaf Mosander became the first to isolate the metal.</p>
      <p>Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters.
      Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.
      Cerium-doped YAG phosphor is used in conjunction with blue light-emitting diodes to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources.</p>
      <p>Cerium has no known biological role in humans but is not particularly toxic, except with intense or continued exposure.</p>
