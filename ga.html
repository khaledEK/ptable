      <p>Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery metal in standard temperature and pressure. 
      In its liquid state, it becomes silvery white. 
      If too much force is applied, the gallium may fracture conchoidally.
      Gallium is similar to the other metals of its group (aluminium, indium, and thallium).</p>
      <p>Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores (such as sphalerite) and in bauxite. 
      Elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than 29.76 °C (85.57 °F), and will melt in a person's hands at normal human body temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).</p>
      <p>Discovered by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875. 
      Since its discovery, gallium has widely been used to make alloys with low melting points. 
      It is also used in semiconductors, as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.</p>
      <p>The melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point. 
      Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. 
      An even lower melting point of −19 °C (−2 °F), well below the freezing point of water, is claimed for the alloy galinstan (62–⁠95% gallium, 5–⁠22% indium, and 0–⁠16% tin by weight), but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling.</p>
      <p>Gallium is predominantly used in electronics. 
      Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. 
      Semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes and diode lasers.
      Gallium is considered a technology-critical element by the United States National Library of Medicine and Frontiers Media.</p> 
      <p>Gallium is also used in the production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.</p> 
      <p>Gallium has no known natural role in biology. 
      Gallium(III) behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
