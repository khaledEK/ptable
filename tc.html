      <p>Technetium is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive.</p>
      <p>All available technetium is produced as a synthetic element.
      Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore, the most common source, or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores.</p>
      <p>This silvery gray, crystalline transition metal has chemical properties which are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements.
      The most common naturally occurring isotope is <sup>99</sup>Tc, in traces only.</p>
      <p>Many of technetium's properties had been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before it was discovered.
      In 1937, technetium (specifically the technetium-97 isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name.</p>
      <p>One short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer, technetium-99m, is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of tests, such as bone cancer diagnoses.
      The ground state of the nuclide technetium-99 is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles.</p>
      <p>Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are byproducts of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods.</p>
      <p>Because even the longest-lived isotope of technetium has a relatively short half-life (4.21 million years), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.</p>
