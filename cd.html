      <p>Cadmium is a soft, silvery-white metal and is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury.
      Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11.
      Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states.</p>
      <p>The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm).</p>
      <p>It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.
      Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production.</p>
      <p>Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange, and yellow pigments, to color glass, and to stabilize plastic.</p>
      <p>Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries.
      One of its few new uses is in cadmium telluride solar panels.</p>
      <p>Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms.</p>
