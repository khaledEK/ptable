      <p>Antimony is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>).</p>
      <p>Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics.
      The earliest known description of the metal in the West was written in 1540 by Vannoccio Biringuccio.</p>
      <p>China is the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan.</p>
      <p>The industrial methods for refining antimony from stibnite are roasting followed by reduction with carbon, or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.</p>
      <p>The largest applications for metallic antimony are in alloys with lead and tin, which have improved properties for solders, bullets, and plain bearings.
      It improves the rigidity of lead-alloy plates in leadâ€“acid batteries. Antimony trioxide is a prominent additive for halogen-containing flame retardants.
      Antimony is used as a dopant in semiconductor devices.</p>
