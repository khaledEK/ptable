      <p>Rhenium is a silvery-gray, heavy.
      With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p>Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element.
      Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores.
      Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from âˆ’1 to +7.</p>
      <p>Discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke and Otto Berg in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered.</p>
      <p>Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines.
      These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element.</p>
      <p>The second-most important use is as a catalyst: rhenium is an excellent catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization.
      Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is expensive.</p>
