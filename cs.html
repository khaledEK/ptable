      <p>Caesium is a soft, silvery-golden alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C, which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature.
      Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium.</p>
      <p>It is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at −116 °C.
      It is the least electronegative element, with a value of 0.79 on the Pauling scale.
      Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite.</p>
      <p>It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133.
      The element has 40 known isotopes, making it, along with barium and mercury, one of the elements with the most isotopes.
      Caesium-137, a fission product, is extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.</p>
      <p>The German chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy.</p>
      <p>The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "getter" in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells.</p>
      <p>In 1967, acting on Einstein's proof that the speed of light is the most-constant dimension in the universe, the International System of Units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium-133 to co-define the second and the metre.
      Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks.</p>
      <p>Since the 1990s, the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids, but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry.</p>
      <p>The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology.</p>
      <p>Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic, but the pure metal's tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material, and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.</p>
