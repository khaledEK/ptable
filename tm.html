      <p>Like the other lanthanides, thulium's most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; however, the +2 oxidation state can also be stable.
      In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules.</p>
      <p>In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium, respectively.
      A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911.</p>
      <p>Thulium is the second-least abundant of the lanthanides, after radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities on Earth.
      It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster.
      It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air.</p>
      <p>Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices, and in some solid-state lasers.
      It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic.</p>
