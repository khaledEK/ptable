      <p>Barium is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal.
      Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element.
      The most common minerals of barium are baryte (barium sulfate, BaSO<sub>4</sub>) and witherite (barium carbonate, BaCO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
      <p>Barium was identified as a new element in 1772, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis.
      Barium has few industrial applications.
      Historically, it was used as a getter for vacuum tubes and in oxide form as the emissive coating on indirectly heated cathodes.</p>
      <p>It is a component of YBCO (high-temperature superconductors) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure.
      Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color.
      Barium sulfate is used as an insoluble additive to oil well drilling fluid.
      In a purer form it is used as X-ray radiocontrast agents for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract.</p>
      <p>Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous and have been used as rodenticides.</p>
