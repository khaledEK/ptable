    <p style="height: 20px; margin-top: 12%">Naming: from German "kobald" meaning "goblin" because they were poor in known metals and gave off poisonous fumes when smelted</p>

      <p>Cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.</p> 
      <p>The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver metal.</p>
      <p>Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was for a long time thought to be due to the known metal bismuth.</p> 
      <p>Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). 
      The element is, however, more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining.</p> 
      <p>The Copperbelt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production.</p>
      <p>Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. 
      The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes.</p> 
      <p>Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays.</p>
      <p>Cobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. 
      Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals. 
      Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, algae, and fungi.</p>
