      <p>Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals.</p>
      <p>Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.
      The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.</p>
      <p>The free element, a silvery metal with a grey cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.</p>
      <p>It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of the world production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys.
      Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when molybdenum-bearing minerals contact oxygen and water, the resulting molybdate ion (MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2âˆ’</sup> is quite soluble.</p>
      <p>Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production of the element) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications as pigments and catalysts.</p>
      <p>Molybdenum-bearing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of biological nitrogen fixation.
      At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria, plants, and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation.</p>
      <p>These nitrogenases contain an iron-molybdenum cofactor FeMoco, which is believed to contain either Mo(III) or Mo(IV).
      This is distinct from the fully oxidized Mo(VI) found complexed with molybdopterin in all other molybdenum-bearing enzymes, which perform a variety of crucial functions.</p>
      <p>The variety of crucial reactions catalyzed by these latter enzymes means that molybdenum is an essential element for all higher eukaryote organisms, including humans.</p>
