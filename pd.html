      <p>Palladium is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston.</p>
      <p>Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs).
      They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.</p>
      <p>More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into nontoxic substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor).</p>
      <p>Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry.
      Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity, heat, and water.</p>
      <p>Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare.
      The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.</p>
