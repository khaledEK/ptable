      <p style="font-size: 120%">Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals, at approximately one third that of steel. 
      Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. 
      It is soft, non-magnetic and ductile.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">It has one stable isotope, <sup>27</sup>Al; this isotope is very common, making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the Universe. 
      The radioactivity of <sup>26</sup>Al is used in radiodating.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Chemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. 
      The aluminium cation Al<sup>3+</sup> is small and highly charged; as such, it is polarizing, and bonds aluminium forms tend towards covalency.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">The strong affinity towards oxygen leads to aluminium's common association with oxygen in nature in the form of oxides; for this reason, aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">The discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. 
      Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 120%">In World Wars I and II, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. 
      In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. 
      In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 120%">Despite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to use aluminium salts for metabolism, but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.</p>
